# Next Notion Blog

‚ö†Ô∏è If you want something robust that's working, go with [samuelkraft/notion-blog-nextjs](https://github.com/samuelkraft/notion-blog-nextjs), this is just my playground.

It should be possible to run a blog off of Notion. Heavily work in progress, build with Next.js and the Notion API.
